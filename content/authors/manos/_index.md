I am the Founder and Head of the Cyber Risk Lab [(CRL)](https://www.cyberrisklab.co.uk/) at the University of Greenwich. CRL consists of PhD students, junior researchers, research fellows, visiting researchers, and industrial experts. Its research outcomes are in the field of cyber risk capitalising on expertise in multi-agents systems and mathematical optimisation creating AI-powered solutions for optimal risk mitigation. CRL's goal is to invent, develop, and evaluate new models and methods. CRL's impact strategy is to contribute to a more secure UK society against cyber threats. Besides heading CRL, I direct the Cyber Risk Research strategy of the Internet of Things and Security Centre [(ISEC)](https://www.gre.ac.uk/research/groups/isec) acting as its liaison with industrial partners.

I sit on the Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security [(GameSec)](https://www.gamesec-conf.org/) Advisory Committee panel. GameSec is a small but highly specialised conference in the intersection of cybersecurity and decision support. It attracts high quality contributions and has been instrumental in building and maintaining the community around this topic. It is ranked 20-th among all computer science conferences for computer security and cryptography, one position below the prestigious IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium [(source)](https://research.com/conference-rankings/computer-science/2021/computer-security-cryptography).

I am an Associate Editor of the IET Information Security journal, reviewer of numerous high impact factor journals including IEEE TIFS and TDSC, Senior member of the IEEE, Advisory Board member of the H2020 SPIDER project, member of the [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org) Associate Peer Review College, Member of the College of Peer Reviewers of the [(REPHRAIN)](https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/) (National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online), External Evaluator for the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.


My research has been funded by the National Cyber Security Centre [(NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security [(RISCS)](https://www.riscs.org.uk/), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org/), the European Commission [(H2020)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en), and the Greenwich Research & Enterprise (GRE). I have been involved, as Principal and co-Investigator, in grants in worth in excess of £20m, leading tasks, work packages, and the preparation of their bids. In total, I have attracted £1.15M as P.I. and £1.08M as co-I.

My research involves:
* Modelling cyber risk using threat modelling, vulnerability assessment, control-based risk assessment.
* Studying the impact of cyber attacks in numerous use cases including healthcare, smart home, smart grid, and 5G infrastructure.
* Designing and developing robust architectures as well as AI-powered decision-support methods to mitigate cyber risks.
* Modelling cybersecurity decisions using Cost-Benefit Analysis and AI techniques based on game theory and optimisation to determine optimal cyber-related behaviours subject to limited resources.
