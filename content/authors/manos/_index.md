I am a Professor of Cyber Security and Head of Cyber Risk at the Internet of Things and Security Centre [(ISEC)](https://www.gre.ac.uk/research/groups/isec). ISEC is located at the University of Greenwich, Faculty of Engineering and Science, School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. I direct the Cyber Risk research strategy of ISEC acting also as its liaison with industrial partners.

ISEC aims at equipping the Internet of Things with the ability to adapt to the needs of human beings and self-protect against cyber security, safety and privacy threats. With 28 members of staff and PhD students and an annual budget over £2M, it specialises in security and privacy technologies for distributed digital environments where a security breach in cyber space can affect people and systems in physical space, from smart homes and smart buildings to robotics, e-commerce and corporate environments. Our members specialise in embedded system security, mathematical modelling, formal methods, optimisation and machine learning together with practitioner skills in penetration testing and digital forensics. The centre’s research strategy prioritises multidisciplinary research and the validation of theoretical grounding with laboratory and in-the-wild experimentation with end-users.

My research interests are at the intersection of security and privacy engineering, multi-agent systems and mathematical optimisation. My core expertise is designing and implementing robust cyber security defences against adversarial behaviour including threat modelling and cyber risk optimisation. One of my main goals is to invent, develop, and evaluate new models and methods that can be adopted by organisations and individuals. This is aligned with ISEC's impact strategy to contribute to a secure UK society against cyber-physical threats.

My research has been funded by the National Cyber Security Centre [(NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security [(RISCS)](https://www.riscs.org.uk/), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org/), the European Commission [(H2020)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en), and the Greenwich Research & Enterprise (GRE). I have been involved, as Principal and co-Investigator, in grants in worth in excess of £20m, leading tasks, work packages, and the preparation of their bids. In total, I have attracted £1.15M as P.I. and £1.08M as co-I.

<!-- **Service** - I sit on the Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security [(GameSec)](https://www.gamesec-conf.org/) Advisory Committee panel. GameSec is a small and highly specialised conference in the intersection of cybersecurity and decision support. It has been instrumental in building and maintaining the community around this topic while it is ranked 20th among all computer science conferences for computer security and cryptography, one position below the prestigious IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium [(source)](https://research.com/conference-rankings/computer-science/2021/computer-security-cryptography).

I am an Associate Editor of the IET Information Security journal, reviewer of numerous high impact factor journals including IEEE TIFS and TDSC, Senior member of the IEEE, Advisory Board member of the H2020 SPIDER and H2020 SECANT projects, member of the [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org) Associate Peer Review College, Member of the College of Peer Reviewers of the [(REPHRAIN)](https://www.rephrain.ac.uk/) (National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online), and External Evaluator for the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education. -->

<!-- **Research Funding**  -->

<!-- My research involves:
* Modelling cyber risk using threat modelling, vulnerability assessment, control-based risk assessment.
* Studying the impact of cyber attacks in numerous use cases including healthcare, smart home, smart grid, and 5G infrastructure.
* Designing and developing robust architectures as well as AI-powered decision-support methods to mitigate cyber risks.
* Modelling cybersecurity decisions using Cost-Benefit Analysis and AI techniques based on game theory and optimisation to determine optimal cyber-related behaviours subject to limited resources. -->
