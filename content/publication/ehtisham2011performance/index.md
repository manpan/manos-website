abstract: "WiMAX is a wireless digital communication system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard which provides
broadband wireless Internet access at very high rates that is up to 70 Mbps or a data rate of about 3
Mbps within a radius of 30-mile (data rate increases as the distance decreases). With the rapid increase
in the wireless broadband use, the need for wireless fixed and mobile metropolitan area networks has
ever been increasing. Multimedia communications, including audio and video are highly bandwidth
demanding and error sensitive. When the coverage area of the wireless network technology is as high as
with WiMAX, security becomes one of the most important issues.WiMAX, both mobile and fixed, has
many attractive features such as connection-oriented MAC layer, provision of the Quality-of-Service
(QoS) for different applications, efficient mobility and power save mode features. Needless to say, all
these attractive features must be protected against malicious activities by security mechanisms.Providing
secure multimedia communications by using a broadband wireless technology like WiMAXis likely to be
challenging due to time or space overhead that occur. Security mechanisms might increase packet sizes
thus delay, jitter and throughput are increased. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of secure
video transmission over WiMAX networks under different cryptographic algorithms by using the OPNET
simulator. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the security extensions
giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios."
