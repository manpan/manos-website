abstract: "In this article, we investigated, using game theory, the competition in a shared open spectrum between two operators. We proposed a new way of maximization of the network throughput, and we provided new ways toward the provision of fairness. We computed an NE and NBS of an NPG and CPG, respectively. Regarding strategies and the best game to be played, there is no single answer. The best solution depends on the perspective. However, the CPG is more effective in terms of clients' experienced quality of service. Our future work involves experimenting with more than two APs in the shared area and evaluating various quality of service metrics."
