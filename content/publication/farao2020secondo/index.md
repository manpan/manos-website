abstract: "This paper represents the SECONDO framework to assist organizations with decisions related to cybersecurity investments and cyber-insurance. The platform supports cybersecurity and cyber-insurance decisions by implementing and integrating a number of software components. SECONDO operates in three distinct phases: (i) cyber-physical risk assessment and continuous monitoring; (ii) investment-driven optimized cyber-physical risk control; and (iii) blockchain-enabled cyber-insurance contract preparation and maintenance. Insurers can leverage SECONDO functionalities to actively participate in the management of cyber-physical risks of a shipping company to reduce their insured risk."
