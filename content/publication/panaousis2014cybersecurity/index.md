abstract: "In this paper we investigate how to optimally invest in cybersecurity controls.
We are particularly interested in examining cases where
the organization suffers from an underinvestment problem or inefficient
spending on cybersecurity. To this end, we first model the cybersecurity
environment of an organization. We then model non-cooperative cybersecurity
control-games between the defender which abstracts all defense mechanisms of the
organization and the attacker which can exploit different vulnerabilities at
different network locations. To implement our methodology we use the SANS Top 20
Critical Security Controls and the 2011 CWE/SANS top 25 most dangerous software errors.
Based on the profile of an organization, which forms its preferences in terms of
indirect costs, its concerns about different kinds of threats and the importance of
the assets given their associated risks we derive the Nash Equilibria of a series of
control-games. These game solutions are then handled by optimization techniques, in
particular multi-objective, multiple choice Knapsack to determine the optimal cybersecurity investment.
Our methodology provides security effective and cost efficient solutions
especially against commodity attacks. We believe our work can be used
to advise security managers on how they should spend an available cybersecurity budget
given their organization profile."
