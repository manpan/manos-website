abstract: "This paper characterizes a contract signing protocol with high efficiency in Internet of Things. Recent studies show that existing contract-signing protocols can achieve abuse-freeness and resist inference attack, but cannot meet the high-efficiency and convenience requirement of the future Internet of things applications. To solve this problem, we propose a novel contract-signing protocol. Our proposed protocol includes two main parts: 1) we use the partial public key of the sender, instead of the zero-knowledge protocol, to verify the intermediate result; 2) we employ two independent Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) to prevent the honest-but-curious TTP. Our analysis shows that our double TTP protocol can not only result in lower computational cost, but also can achieve abuse-freeness with trapdoor commitment scheme. In a word, our proposed scheme performs better than the state of the art in terms of four metrics: encryption time, number of exponentiations, data to be exchanged and exchange steps in one round contract-signing."
