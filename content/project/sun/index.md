Extended reality (XR) is an emerging technology with promising potential in many fields including health, communication and safety. However, overcoming XR’s limitations in providing authentic interactive social environments is key to further developing its applications. The EU-funded SUN project aims to advance the social interactivity of XR technology by establishing scalable models with sustained and convincing virtual environments. The project will also improve the data-processing capability of wearable devices and develop wearable sensors and tactile interfaces to improve user experience. SUN will validate these models in three real-life situations: rehabilitation therapy, improved safety and social interaction among workers, and facilitate interaction for disabled users.
